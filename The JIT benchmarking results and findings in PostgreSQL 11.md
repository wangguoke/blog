## The JIT benchmarking results and findings in PostgreSQL 11

Just-in-time compilation of SQL statements is one of the new features in PostgreSQL 11. Just-in-Time compilation (JIT) is the process of turning some form of interpreted program evaluation into a native program and doing so at runtime. While doing some testing and benchmarking with JIT it appears that PostgreSQL 11 is about 29.31% faster at executing the TPC-H Q1 query than PostgreSQL 10. You could get details from https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2018/09/11/postgresql-11-just-in-time/.

The JIT technique is implemented using LLVM.

#### What is the LLVM?
>The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines. The name "LLVM" itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the project.

#### Is the JIT necessary?
In today's enterprise, the data has been growing at an unprecedented rate, with a sharp rise in data, the requirement for performing business intelligence and analytical queries is also increasing. Most enterprises are also relying upon to store there very large historical data in NoSQL or distributed storage like Hadoop for performing complex analytical queries. Having said that the OLAP capabilities of the database are also getting there run for the money, the OLAP workloads are increasing and hence the need to enhance database OLAP functionality to handle the growing OLAP workloads. OLAP functionality is primarily affected by data throughput and CPU computing power. Now with the rise of SSD, Column Storage, and Distributed Databases, I/O is not the main bottleneck of the database. Modern databases add a lot of logical and virtual function calls in response to various scenarios. This reduces the efficiency of OLAP capabilities for the database. In the PostgreSQL 11, they added the Just-in-Time compilation, which could reduce the redundant logical operations and virtual function calls.

#### JIT Accelerated Operations in PostgreSQL 11
>Currently PostgreSQL's JIT implementation has support for accelerating expression evaluation and tuple deforming. Several other operations could be accelerated in the future.

>Expression evaluation is used to evaluate WHERE clauses, target lists, aggregates and projections. It can be accelerated by generating code specific to each case.

>Tuple deforming is the process of transforming an on-disk tuple (see Section 68.6.1) into its in-memory representation. It can be accelerated by creating a function specific to the table layout and the number of columns to be extracted.

The first time I came into contact with this technology was using the Vitesse database. In recent years, some new database products with this technology have been discovered.

Vitesse DB:
* Proprietary database based on PostgreSQL 9.5.x
* JIT compiling expressions as well as execution plan
* Speedup up to 8x on TPC-H Q1


Butterstein D., Grust T., Precision Performance Surgery for PostgreSQL â€“
LLVM-based Expression Compilation, Just in Time. VLDB 2016.
* JIT compiling expressions for Filter and Aggregation
* Speedup up to 37% on TPC-H


New expression interpreter (by Andres Freund, PostgreSQL 11):
* Changes tree walker based interpreter to more effective one
* Also adds LLVM JIT for expressions
* Speedup up to 30% on TPC-H

I find that the JIT is disabled by default in PostgreSQL 11. The purpose of this blog is to perform testing and benchmarking of JIT and in particular compare PostgreSQL 11 with JIT with PostgreSQL 10. The testing should demonstrate the performance benefits of JIT with PG 11, it will also identify areas of improvements and suggestions on how to make the improvements.

#### My Hardware Configurationï¼š
* CPU : i5 8400
* Memory : 16G DDR4
* Disk : Inter SSD 1T
* OS : CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core)

#### Install the PostgreSQL 11 from the source with llvm
PostgreSQL has built-in support to perform JIT compilation using LLVM when PostgreSQL is built with --with-llvm. In the first, you need to install llvm5.0. Then you can install the PostgreSQL 11 and PostgreSQL 10.

```
./configure --prefix=/home/postgres/pg11JIT --with-openssl --with-libxml --with-libxslt --with-llvm
make -j6; make install
cd contrib
make -j6; make install

./configure --prefix=/home/postgres/pgdb10 --with-openssl --with-libxml --with-libxslt
make -j6; make install
cd contrib
make -j6; make install
```
#### The configuration variable about JIT
>The configuration variable jit determines whether JIT compilation is enabled or disabled. If it is enabled, the configuration variables jit_above_cost, jit_inline_above_cost, and jit_optimize_above_cost determine whether JITcompilation is performed for a query, and how much effort is spent in doing so.

>jit_provider determines which JIT implementation is used. It is rarely required to be changed.

#### Enabling The JIT in PostgreSQL 11
If you install the PostgreSQL 11 successfully, you will find a new folder named bit_code. There is a lot of file with the .bc extension. These are pre-generated bytecodes for LLVM for facilitating features like in-lining.

I have changed some configuration variable in PostgreSQL10 and PostgreSQL11, the configuration parameters settings between the two servers in order to get an apples ot apples comparison.
```
hared_buffers = 4GB
temp_buffers = 64MB
work_mem = 32MB
maintenance_work_mem = 1GB
wal_level = minimal
max_wal_senders = 0
max_wal_size = 40GB
random_page_cost = 1.1
jit = on
```
Let's try the JIT(For a simple demonstration, I will take these parameters as 0;):
```
[postgres@neoc bin]$ ./psql
psql (11.2)
Type "help" for help.

                                                                       QUERY PLAN

```

I used the tool pg_tpch to get the benchmarking results. For detailed usage, please refer to the URL: https://github.com/wangguoke/blog/blob/master/How%20to%20use%20the%20pg_tpch.md.

We could get the results like this(unit is second, JIT disabled in PG11 and JIT enabled in PG11):
![PG112](/assets/PG112_atz0727xa.png)
The total is the sum of all 22 SQL execution times.
To be more intuitive, we can look at the histogram:
![pg11h](/assets/pg11h.png)

We will find that the execution time is reduced by turning on the JIT, about 6.1% down.

With the JIT turned on, performance has dropped. It may be that my test case and hardware do not meet the test requirements.
So I checked the explain. I found an interesting thing that the JIT disabled used less time than JIT enabled in the Nested Loop.

If I turned the enable_nestloop off, time would be significantly reduced. But the query optimizer chose nested loop instead of others. I don't know if this is a problem.

If you want to know more details about explains, please refer to https://github.com/wangguoke/blog/tree/master/results%20about%20tpch.

We could get the results like this(unit is second, JIT disabled in PG11 and PG10):
![1110noJIT](/assets/1110noJIT.png)

To be more intuitive, we can look at the histogram:
![1110noJITh](/assets/1110noJITh.png)
We could get that the performance of the PG11 is 41% higher than the PG10. This shows that PG11 has made a lot of improvements in performance. Please refer to the official documentation for detailed information.

To be more intuitive, we can look at the histogram:

We could get that the performance of the PG11 is 37.1% higher than the PG10.

#### overall summary of JIT performance:
This JIT depends on the situation. In the 22 SQL cases, performance has improved, and some have declined.
Although I don't know if there is a problem with the query optimizer, it would be better if the optimizer could choose a better path. In a meeting, someone talked to me about Oracle. They told me about the Adaptive Execution Plans and the Hint technology of Oracle. Although Oracle is now losing on the cloud, its database technology is still very advanced. Its query optimizer can convert the nestloop to hash join or others if it needs. The underlying optimization technology of llvm is superior to humans. If there is a problem with the query optimizer, We can improve our query optimizer based on the information provided by LLVM. But this is a large project.

So I have 3 suggestions for Improvement:
1. Add new parameters to find the right case for query optimizer.
2. We can add some special passes for PostgreSQL.
3. We can improve our query optimizer based on the information provided by LLVM.
